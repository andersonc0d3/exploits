This vulnerability exists due to FreeBSD manage the Linux binaries' ioctl, then, the exploit must be a linux ELF binary.

To use the exploit you need to build the exploit called CVE-2012-4576.c using one linux distro and copy the binary to FreeBSD and run it.

If you know how I can build the Elf Linux Binary from FreeBSD without need install any tool, let me know.
