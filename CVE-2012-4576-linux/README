This vulnerability exists due to FreeBSD manage the Linux binaries' ioctl, so the exploit must be a linux ELF binary.

In order to use this exploit you need to compile the CVE-2012-4576-linux.c in a Linux box, copy the binary to FreeBSD and run it.

If you know how to compile the ELF Linux Binary from FreeBSD without the need of installing external tool, let me know.
