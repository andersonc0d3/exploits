This vulnerability exists due the lack of validation of Linux binaries' ioctl SIOCGIFCONF by the FreeBSD, for that reason the exploit must be a linux ELF binary.

In order to use this exploit you need to compile the file CVE-2012-4576-linux.c in a Linux box, copy the binary to FreeBSD and run it.

If you know how to compile the ELF Linux Binary from FreeBSD without the need of installing external tool, let me know.

This exploits only works if the first interface listed as result from ioctl is named "em0", if it is not, some changes need to be done.
